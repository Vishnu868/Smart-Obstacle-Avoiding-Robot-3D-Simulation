#  Smart Obstacle-Avoiding Robot with 3D Simulation

This project focuses on building a **smart autonomous robot** capable of navigating dynamic environments using **ultrasonic sensors, a real-time camera**, and **ADMM-based convex optimization** for intelligent path planning. The robot includes both **autonomous** and **manual** (Bluetooth & voice command) control modes and supports a **3D simulation environment** for virtual testing.

##  Core Concepts

###  Real-Time Obstacle Detection
- **Ultrasonic sensors** detect obstacles within range
- **Servo motor** scans the area left-right to build a range map
- **Camera feed** processes visual obstacles (optional object classification)

###  Kinematic Control
- **Forward Kinematics** for estimating position
- **Inverse Kinematics** to determine motor speeds and turning angles

###  Path Planning with ADMM
- ADMM is used for solving convex optimization problems:
  - Minimize trajectory cost
  - Avoid dynamic obstacles
  - Re-plan in real-time when environment changes

###  Voice and Bluetooth Control
- Commands like `forward`, `left`, `stop` via mobile app or microphone
- Uses Android Serial Bluetooth terminal or custom voice app
